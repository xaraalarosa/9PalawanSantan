    <h1>Lesson 1: Song to Celia by Ben Jonson</h1>

<p>— Ben Jonson established himself as one of the towering figures of English literature. He made important contributions to stage comedy and English poetry. As a poet, he is known for his graceful and clear expression, his command in the use of wit, and his display of classical Greek and Latin learning.</p>

<p>Drink to me only with thine eyes And I will pledge with mine; Or leave a kiss but in the cup, And I'll not look for wine. The thirst that from the soul doth rise Doth ask a drink divine: But might I of Jove's nectar sup I would not change for thine. I sent thee late a rosy wreath, Not so much honouring thee As giving it a hope that there It could not withered be But thou thereon didst only breathe And sent'st it back to me: Since, when it grows and smells, I swear, Not of itself but thee.</p>

    <h1>Lesson 2: On His Blindness by John Milton</h1>

<p>John Milton used his art and craft to address religious and political issues of his time. He became blind in 1652 but his blindness did not make him give up poetic composition. “On His Blindness” is an autobiographical sonnet in which Milton meditates on his loss of sight, first published in 1673. The sonnet refers to his blindness and his dedication of his powers to God.</p>

<h2>Poem</h2>
<p>When I consider how my light is spent Ere half my days in this dark world and wide, And that one talent which is death to hide Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent To serve therewith my Maker, and present My true account, lest He returning chide; "Doth God exact day-labor, light denied?" I fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent That murmur, soon replies, "God doth not need Either man's work or his own gifts. Who best Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state is kingly, thousands at his bidding speed And post o'er land and ocean without rest; They also serve who only stand and wait."</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>What is the poem about?</li>
  <li>What is bothering the speaker in the poem?</li>
  <li>What does the speaker ask God? Was it answered? By whom?</li>

    <h1>Lesson 4: S-LV-C Pattern</h1>

<h2>The S-LV-C Pattern</h2>
<p>The <b>Subject (S)</b> is what is talked about in the sentence. The <b>Linking Verb (LV)</b> connects the subject to the complement. The <b>Complement (C)</b> can be an adjective, noun, or pronoun.</p>

<p>Example: <i>Celia is beautiful</i> (Celia — Subject, is — Linking Verb, beautiful — Complement).</p>

<h2>The S-IV Pattern</h2>
<p>The <b>Subject (S)</b> refers to what is talked about, and the <b>Intransitive Verb (IV)</b> states a doable activity without needing an object.</p>

<p>Example: <i>The criminals escape</i> (Criminals — Subject, escape — Intransitive Verb).</p>
