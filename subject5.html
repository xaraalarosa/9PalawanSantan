<h2>LESSON 1: THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</h2>

<h3>AIR</h3>
<p>
    - It is a mixture of gases. It contains OXYGEN which supports energy-producing processes in cells.<br>
    - 21% oxygen, 0.04% Carbon Dioxide – Inhale<br>
    - 78% Nitrogen, 16.4% Oxygen – Exhale
</p>

<h3>WHAT IS THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM?</h3>
<p>
    - It is the organ system or the structure of organs in your body that allows you to breathe.<br>
    - It is divided into 2 parts. 
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT:</strong> consists of the nose/nostrils, nasal cavity, mouth, throat (pharynx), and the voice box (larynx)</li>
    <li><strong>LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT:</strong> consists of the Trachea (windpipe), Bronchi, Bronchioles, and Lungs</li>
</ol>

<h3>4 RESPIRATION PROCESSES</h3>
<ol>
    <li>BREATHING (VENTILATION): Air into and out of the lungs.</li>
    <li>EXTERNAL RESPIRATION: Gas exchange between air and blood.</li>
    <li>INTERNAL RESPIRATION: Gas exchange between blood and tissues.</li>
    <li>CELLULAR RESPIRATION: Oxygen use to produce ATP, carbon dioxide as waste.</li>
</ol>

<h3>PARTS OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>NOSE/NOSTRILS:</strong> This organ serves as an entrance for air to enter your body.</li>
    <li><strong>NASAL CAVITY:</strong> Lies above the bone that forms the roof of the mouth. Air passes here during breathing. It filters and warms the air and makes it moist before entering the lungs.</li>
    <li><strong>PHARYNX:</strong> Also Known as "The Throat," a muscular funnel-shaped passageway. It connects the mouth and nose to the esophagus. It is a common passageway for food and air.</li>
    <li><strong>LARYNX:</strong> Also known as the "Voice Box." It is used for breathing, swallowing, and talking.</li>
    <li><strong>TRACHEA:</strong> The airway that leads air from the larynx to the bronchi. This organ connects the Upper and Lower Respiratory Tract.</li>
    <li><strong>BRONCHI:</strong> The Y-shaped tube that connects to your trachea and directs the air you breathe into your lungs.</li>
    <li><strong>LUNGS:</strong> A pair of organs in the chest that supplies the body with oxygen and removes carbon dioxide from the body.</li>
    <li><strong>BRONCHIOLES:</strong> The smallest airways inside the lungs that lead the air directly to the alveoli.</li>
    <li><strong>ALVEOLI:</strong> Microscopic balloon-shaped organs that are in charge of gas exchange. These are located at the end of the respiratory tree.</li>
</ol>

<h3>MALFUNCTIONS AND DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>ASTHMA:</strong> Severe allergic reactions characterized by the constriction of bronchioles.</li>
    <li><strong>BRONCHITIS:</strong> Inflammation of the lining of the bronchioles.</li>
    <li><strong>EMPHYSEMA:</strong> Condition in which the alveoli deteriorate, causing the lungs to lose their elasticity.</li>
    <li><strong>PNEUMONIA:</strong> Condition in which the alveoli become filled with fluid, preventing the exchange of gases.</li>
    <li><strong>LUNG CANCER:</strong> Irregular and uncontrolled growth of tumors in the lung tissue.</li>
    <li><strong>TUBERCULOSIS:</strong> Caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium Tuberculosis. It is an infectious disease that can cause infection in your lungs or other tissues.</li>
    <li><strong>CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD):</strong> A common lung disease causing restricted airflow and breathing problems. It is sometimes called emphysema or chronic bronchitis. In people with COPD, the lungs can get damaged or clogged with phlegm.</li>

    <h2>CIRCULATORY SYSTEM</h2>
<p>
    The Circulatory System covers the organs of the Heart, Blood, and Blood Vessels.<br>
    3 main parts of the Circulatory System: Heart, Blood, and Blood Vessels.
</p>

<h3>Heart</h3>
<p>
    The heart can be the size of a person’s clenched fist. It is divided into 4 chambers: Right Atrium, Left Atrium, Right Ventricle, and Left Ventricle. The purpose of the heart is to pump blood throughout the body.<br>
    The upper chambers are known as the atrium and the lower ones as ventricles.
</p>
<p>
    In these four chambers, there are valves that prevent blood from flowing backward:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tricuspid Valve:</strong> Located between the right ventricle and right atrium, connecting both chambers.</li>
    <li><strong>Pulmonary Valve:</strong> Delivers blood to the lungs.</li>
    <li><strong>Mitral Valve:</strong> Receives blood from the pulmonary vein and transfers it to the aortic valve.</li>
    <li><strong>Aortic Valve:</strong> Sends blood to the aorta, and from there, into the body.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The cycle repeats as blood returns to the heart through the Vena Cava.
</p>

<h3>Blood</h3>
<p>
    Blood is also known as the "River of Life." It transports important elements needed by the body for protection and survival.
</p>
<h4>Cells of the Blood:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Red Blood Cells (RBC)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>White Blood Cells (WBC)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Platelets</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
    These cells are transferred by a liquid-like substance known as Plasma.
</p>

<h3>Blood Vessels</h3>
<p>
    Blood vessels carry blood throughout the body. There are three types:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Arteries:</strong> Large vessels that accommodate pumping blood.</li>
    <li><strong>Veins:</strong> Veins keep blood moving in one direction.</li>
    <li><strong>Capillaries:</strong> The smallest blood vessels, connected to the organs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Diseases of the Circulatory System</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Atherosclerosis:</strong> The blocking of blood vessels by plaque.</li>
    <li><strong>Stroke:</strong> A blockage caused by the hardening of arteries, which stops blood flow to the brain or neck.</li>
    <li><strong>Coronary Heart Disease:</strong> Blockage of plaque in the heart, which thickens and hardens artery walls, reducing blood volume.</li>
    <li><strong>HHD (Hypertensive Heart Disease):</strong> Caused by elevated blood pressure due to narrowing of arterioles (the smallest arteries).</li>
    <li><strong>RHD (Rheumatic Heart Disease):</strong> Typically occurs in children, damaging the valves due to a bacterial infection.</li>
    <li><strong>Hemophilia:</strong> A blood disorder that causes improper blood clotting, which can be passed down genetically.</li>
    <li><strong>Anemia:</strong> A decrease in RBCs caused by low iron levels.</li>
    <li><strong>Leukemia:</strong> An abnormal count of WBCs, often abnormally large and cancer-like.</li>
</ul>
