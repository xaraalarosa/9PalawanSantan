    <h1>SCIENCE REVIEWER</h1>

<h2>LESSON 1: THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</h2>

<h3>AIR</h3>
<p>
    - It is a mixture of gases. It contains OXYGEN which supports energy-producing processes in cells.<br>
    - 21% oxygen, 0.04% Carbon Dioxide – Inhale<br>
    - 78% Nitrogen, 16.4% Oxygen – Exhale
</p>

<h3>WHAT IS THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM?</h3>
<p>
    - It is the organ system or the structure of organs in your body that allows you to breathe.<br>
    - It is divided into 2 parts. 
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT:</strong> consists of the nose/nostrils, nasal cavity, mouth, throat (pharynx), and the voice box (larynx)</li>
    <li><strong>LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT:</strong> consists of the Trachea (windpipe), Bronchi, Bronchioles, and Lungs</li>
</ol>

<h3>4 RESPIRATION PROCESSES</h3>
<ol>
    <li>BREATHING (VENTILATION): Air into and out of the lungs.</li>
    <li>EXTERNAL RESPIRATION: Gas exchange between air and blood.</li>
    <li>INTERNAL RESPIRATION: Gas exchange between blood and tissues.</li>
    <li>CELLULAR RESPIRATION: Oxygen use to produce ATP, carbon dioxide as waste.</li>
</ol>

<h3>PARTS OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>NOSE/NOSTRILS:</strong> This organ serves as an entrance for air to enter your body.</li>
    <li><strong>NASAL CAVITY:</strong> Lies above the bone that forms the roof of the mouth. Air passes here during breathing. It filters and warms the air and makes it moist before entering the lungs.</li>
    <li><strong>PHARYNX:</strong> Also Known as "The Throat," a muscular funnel-shaped passageway. It connects the mouth and nose to the esophagus. It is a common passageway for food and air.</li>
    <li><strong>LARYNX:</strong> Also known as the "Voice Box." It is used for breathing, swallowing, and talking.</li>
    <li><strong>TRACHEA:</strong> The airway that leads air from the larynx to the bronchi. This organ connects the Upper and Lower Respiratory Tract.</li>
    <li><strong>BRONCHI:</strong> The Y-shaped tube that connects to your trachea and directs the air you breathe into your lungs.</li>
    <li><strong>LUNGS:</strong> A pair of organs in the chest that supplies the body with oxygen and removes carbon dioxide from the body.</li>
    <li><strong>BRONCHIOLES:</strong> The smallest airways inside the lungs that lead the air directly to the alveoli.</li>
    <li><strong>ALVEOLI:</strong> Microscopic balloon-shaped organs that are in charge of gas exchange. These are located at the end of the respiratory tree.</li>
</ol>

<h3>MALFUNCTIONS AND DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>ASTHMA:</strong> Severe allergic reactions characterized by the constriction of bronchioles.</li>
    <li><strong>BRONCHITIS:</strong> Inflammation of the lining of the bronchioles.</li>
    <li><strong>EMPHYSEMA:</strong> Condition in which the alveoli deteriorate, causing the lungs to lose their elasticity.</li>
    <li><strong>PNEUMONIA:</strong> Condition in which the alveoli become filled with fluid, preventing the exchange of gases.</li>
    <li><strong>LUNG CANCER:</strong> Irregular and uncontrolled growth of tumors in the lung tissue.</li>
    <li><strong>TUBERCULOSIS:</strong> Caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium Tuberculosis. It is an infectious disease that can cause infection in your lungs or other tissues.</li>
    <li><strong>CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD):</strong> A common lung disease causing restricted airflow and breathing problems. It is sometimes called emphysema or chronic bronchitis. In people with COPD, the lungs can get damaged or clogged with phlegm.</li>

    <h2>CIRCULATORY SYSTEM</h2>
<p>
    The Circulatory System covers the organs of the Heart, Blood, and Blood Vessels.<br>
    3 main parts of the Circulatory System: Heart, Blood, and Blood Vessels.
</p>

<h3>Heart</h3>
<p>
    The heart can be the size of a person’s clenched fist. It is divided into 4 chambers: Right Atrium, Left Atrium, Right Ventricle, and Left Ventricle. The purpose of the heart is to pump blood throughout the body.<br>
    The upper chambers are known as the atrium and the lower ones as ventricles.
</p>
<p>
    In these four chambers, there are valves that prevent blood from flowing backward:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tricuspid Valve:</strong> Located between the right ventricle and right atrium, connecting both chambers.</li>
    <li><strong>Pulmonary Valve:</strong> Delivers blood to the lungs.</li>
    <li><strong>Mitral Valve:</strong> Receives blood from the pulmonary vein and transfers it to the aortic valve.</li>
    <li><strong>Aortic Valve:</strong> Sends blood to the aorta, and from there, into the body.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The cycle repeats as blood returns to the heart through the Vena Cava.
</p>

<h3>Blood</h3>
<p>
    Blood is also known as the "River of Life." It transports important elements needed by the body for protection and survival.
</p>
<h4>Cells of the Blood:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Red Blood Cells (RBC)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>White Blood Cells (WBC)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Platelets</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
    These cells are transferred by a liquid-like substance known as Plasma.
</p>

<h3>Blood Vessels</h3>
<p>
    Blood vessels carry blood throughout the body. There are three types:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Arteries:</strong> Large vessels that accommodate pumping blood.</li>
    <li><strong>Veins:</strong> Veins keep blood moving in one direction.</li>
    <li><strong>Capillaries:</strong> The smallest blood vessels, connected to the organs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Diseases of the Circulatory System</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Atherosclerosis:</strong> The blocking of blood vessels by plaque.</li>
    <li><strong>Stroke:</strong> A blockage caused by the hardening of arteries, which stops blood flow to the brain or neck.</li>
    <li><strong>Coronary Heart Disease:</strong> Blockage of plaque in the heart, which thickens and hardens artery walls, reducing blood volume.</li>
    <li><strong>HHD (Hypertensive Heart Disease):</strong> Caused by elevated blood pressure due to narrowing of arterioles (the smallest arteries).</li>
    <li><strong>RHD (Rheumatic Heart Disease):</strong> Typically occurs in children, damaging the valves due to a bacterial infection.</li>
    <li><strong>Hemophilia:</strong> A blood disorder that causes improper blood clotting, which can be passed down genetically.</li>
    <li><strong>Anemia:</strong> A decrease in RBCs caused by low iron levels.</li>
    <li><strong>Leukemia:</strong> An abnormal count of WBCs, often abnormally large and cancer-like.</li>
</ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <h3>Genes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A gene is a piece of DNA that gives instructions for making proteins, which help determine traits in an organism.</li>
        <li>Also known as Inherited Elements, which can be passed on to the next generation via chromosomes.</li>
        <li>Is a structure of a chromosome.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Allele</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pairs of genes that occupy a specific location on a particular chromosome.</li>
        <li>Contrasting expressions or alternative forms of a trait.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Genetics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Branch of Biology that studies hereditary information.</li>
        <li>Studies how genes bring about the characteristics/traits in living things.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hereditary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Transmission of characteristics from parents to offspring.</li>
        <li>All organisms must carry, store, use, and produce more copies of genetic info that can be passed to the next generations. This info allows organisms to grow, develop, reproduce, and survive in their environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gregor Mendel (Father of Genetics)</h2>
    <p>An Augustinian Monk who performed experiments on the characteristics of a garden pea.</p>
    <p><strong>Why garden pea?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Presence of Observable traits with contrasting forms.</li>
        <li>Production of many offspring in one cross.</li>
        <li>Short life cycle or generation time (fast growth).</li>
        <li>Ease of Manipulating pollination.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Traits Observed</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Plant height</li>
        <li>Pod shape</li>
        <li>Pod color</li>
        <li>Seed shape</li>
        <li>Seed color</li>
        <li>Flower color</li>
        <li>Flower location</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Major Branches of Genetics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mendelian or Classical Genetics: Follows the Law of Inheritance.</li>
        <li>Molecular Genetics: Bio-chemical use in nature.</li>
        <li>Population Genetics: Gene frequency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Terms and Definitions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Variations:</strong> Refers to the difference among individuals that belong to the same species.</li>
        <li><strong>Dominant Gene:</strong> Masks other genes, preventing them from being shown. Represented by uppercase letters.</li>
        <li><strong>Recessive Gene:</strong> Masked by the dominant gene. Represented by lowercase letters.</li>
        <li><strong>Homozygous:</strong> Same code.</li>
        <li><strong>Heterozygous:</strong> Different code. To assign a code, choose the first letter of the phenotype, e.g., TALL, Gtype: T. Tip: When there’s dominant, it’s dominant!</li>
        <li><strong>Monohybrid:</strong> Crossing only one trait, e.g., Tall x Short.</li>
        <li><strong>Dihybrid:</strong> Crossing two or more traits, e.g., Tall x Short x Curly x Straight.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Non-Mendelian Genetics</h3>
    <p>Some traits don’t follow the dominant/recessive rules that Mendel applied. Traits can be controlled by more than one gene. Some alleles are neither dominant nor recessive.</p>

    <h4>Incomplete Dominance</h4>
    <p>One allele is not completely dominant over another. The heterozygous phenotype is a blending of two homozygous phenotypes. Example: rr = red x ww = white (parents) results in Rw = pink (offspring).</p>

    <h4>Codominance</h4>
    <p>Two alleles are both expressed as a dominant phenotype, meaning both traits of the parents are seen in the offspring (no blending). Example: coat color in cows (RR: Red x WW: White results in RW: Roan).</p>

    <h4>Multiple-Allele Series</h4>
    <p>More than two choices of alleles are present for a trait. Example: ABO blood type has three alleles.</p>

    <h3>Determining Blood Type</h3>
    <p>Protein molecules found on the surface of RBCs and in the blood plasma determine the blood type of an individual. Antigens are located on the surface of the red blood cells, while antibodies are in the blood plasma.</p>

    <h4>Different Blood Groups</h4>
    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Blood Group</th>
                <th>Antigens</th>
                <th>Antibodies</th>
                <th>Can give Blood to</th>
                <th>Can receive blood from</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>AB (universal receiver)</td>
                <td>A and B</td>
                <td>None</td>
                <td>AB</td>
                <td>AB, A, B, O</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>A</td>
                <td>A</td>
                <td>B</td>
                <td>A and AB</td>
                <td>A and O</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>B</td>
                <td>B</td>
                <td>A</td>
                <td>B and AB</td>
                <td>B and O</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>O (universal donor)</td>
                <td>None</td>
                <td>A and B</td>
                <td>AB, A, B, O</td>
                <td>O</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Rh Factor</h3>
    <p>Refers to another antigen on red blood cells. The dominant trait is to have the antigen (Rh+), while the recessive trait is not to have it (Rh-). A person with Rh- blood will produce antibodies to Rh+ blood, which can be a problem in pregnancy.</p>

    <h2>Sex-Linked Inheritance Review</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Males have an X and a Y chromosome; females have two X chromosomes.</li>
        <li>These chromosomes determine sex, so genes located on these chromosomes are known as sex-linked genes.</li>
        <li>The X chromosome is much larger than the Y, so it carries more genes than the Y chromosome.</li>
        <li>Disorders that are sex-linked are much more common in males, because they would only need one recessive allele to have the trait; rather than the two recessive alleles the females need.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disorders</h3>
    <h4>Hemophilia</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Recessive trait (hh).</li>
        <li>Disorder where individuals are missing the normal blood clotting protein.</li>
        <li>Uncontrolled bleeds from minor cuts or bruises.</li>
        <li>Female genotype: XhXh</li>
        <li>Male genotype: XhY</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Colorblindness</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Recessive (cc).</li>
        <li>Inability to see certain colors.</li>
        <li>Female genotype: XcXc</li>
        <li>Male genotype: XcY</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Recessive.</li>
        <li>Progressive weakening and loss of skeletal muscle.</li>
        <li>Defective version of gene that codes for muscle protein.</li>
        <li>Female genotype: XdXd</li>
        <li>Male genotype: XdY</li>
