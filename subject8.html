<h3>Italian Madrigals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Considered the most important secular genre of the 16th century.</li>

    <li>Form: single stanza with no refrains or repeated lines, through-composed with new music for each line of poetry.</li>
    <li>Text: composers often used texts by major poets, with topics including love songs and pastoral scenes.</li>
    <li>Music: a variety of techniques and textures, with all voices playing an equal role.</li>
</ul>

<h3>English Madrigals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Started in the late 1500s, tending to be lighter in topic with simpler texts.</li>
    <li>These simpler texts and humor led to the addition of nonsense words like ‘fa-la-la.’</li>
    <li>The Roman school brought polyphonic composition to its highest peak, exemplified by composers like Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina and Thomas Morley.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina</h2>

    <h1>PE Lesson 1: Eating Habits</h1>
    
    <h2>Health - Physical</h2>
    <p>We are able to do tasks without fatigue through exercise and a balanced diet.<br>
    <strong>Remember:</strong> Eating healthy food ensures a healthy life.</p>

    <h2>HEALTH MYTHS</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Myth #1:</strong> Eggs are bad for our heart.</li>
        <p>The cholesterol we eat does not have a huge impact on raising our blood cholesterol. Saturated and trans fats are the main reasons for heart diseases (e.g., mayonnaise, butter, red meat). Limit your cholesterol intake to 2 eggs over the course of a week.</p>

        <li><strong>Myth #2:</strong> Carbohydrates make you fat.</li>
        <p>Carbohydrates can raise your risk of developing health problems like heart disease and diabetes (e.g., rice, white bread, pasta, donuts). Avoiding grains, beans, fruits, and vegetables makes your body miss out on its main source of fuel, as well as nutrients and fibers.</p>

        <li><strong>Myth #3:</strong> A raw food diet provides enzymes that are essential to healthy digestion.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Myth #4:</strong> Calories eaten at night are more fattening than those eaten early in the day.</li>
        <p>What matters are the total calories consumed.</p>

        <li><strong>Myth #5:</strong> The radiation from microwaves creates dangerous compounds in your food.</li>

        <li><strong>Myth #6:</strong> Microwaves destroy nutrients.</li>
        <p>It is the heating and length of time you are cooking that affects nutrient losses, not the cooking method.</p>

        <li><strong>Myth #7:</strong> It is important to fast periodically to cleanse toxins from the body.</li>

        <li><strong>Myth #8:</strong> High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is worse than sugar.</li>
        <p>Their composition is the same as table sugar.</p>

    Lesson 2: Lifestyle Diseases

Lifestyle Diseases:

Associated with the way a person or group of people lives.
Includes heart diseases, stroke, obesity, diabetes, smoking, alcohol, and drug abuse.
Regular physical activity helps prevent diseases. With a good diet and scheduled exercise routine, a person can live a healthy lifestyle.
Obesity:

A medical condition where excess body fat has accumulated, which may have a negative effect on our health.
Most common problem among children and adolescents.
Eating habits are not guarded.
Naturally prevalent in children aged 5 to 10, with up to 5.8% being obese or overweight.
In 2015, obesity was 30% among the fast-growing number of diseases affecting 3 to 10 adults.
Poor Nutrition:

A problem among the rich.
Children from rich families gravitate towards fat-saturated foods that are easy to prepare rather than whole and fresh produce, including fruits, vegetables, and cereals.
Diabetes:

Affects the young generation.
Happens when islet cells in the pancreas are damaged and do not produce enough insulin.
Insulin helps our blood sugar level from getting too high or too low.
Our bodies need fuel to give it energy, and we get this fuel from the foods we eat.
Other Risks:

Smoking, drinking alcohol, stress and anxiety, and poor lifestyle, which lead to heart diseases, high blood pressure, stroke, and cancer.
